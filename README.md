# potential-tribble
Welcome, this is the repository for our next big project for a school class about innovation and stuff, and it's name is:
## AJAJCompress
This is a big and ambicious project, but we believe it's possible, and if we manage to finish it, it would improve our environment GREATLY, so yeah.

So basically this detects if there is any plastic in the sensor and guides it properly. Otherwise, it guides it somewhere else.
Using Arduino.
It's also not a school project (maybe) anymore, btw.
