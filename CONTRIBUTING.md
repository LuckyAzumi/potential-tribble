# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is the main software being used to develop this project,
  * Click on [Requeriments](https://github.com/LuckyAzumi/potential-tribble/blob/master/Requirements.txt) to see what do you need to replicate the project, and where to buy it;
  * Bugs? [Issues](https://github.com/LuckyAzumi/potential-tribble/issues/new/choose) is where to report them.
  * Special thanks to [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) because if it weren't for them and the amazing community, we would not be doing this.
## Testing

We have a handful of features, but most of them are because we thought of them. Please write some examples of how it would be supposed to work, for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to LuckyAzumi](https://github.com/LuckyAzumi/potential-tribble/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are massive (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
